### Hi there 👋  I'm Luke, an ICU nurse by trade, and self-taught Python wizard (if we use the term 'wizard' lightly). I first learned Python in 2022 and have been using it more and more for making my life easier and more efficient.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on acceptance into a doctorate of nurse anesthesia practice program.
- 💬 Ask me about the weekly recipe emailer I made for my wife!
- 🚲 Fun Fact: I own a chameleon purple-blue Dogma F.
